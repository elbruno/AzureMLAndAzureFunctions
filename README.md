During the last couple of months, I‚Äôve having fun with my new friends at home: üêøÔ∏èüêøÔ∏èüêøÔ∏è. These little ones, are extremelly funny, and they literally don‚Äôt care about the cold ü•∂‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è.

So, I decided to help them and build an Automatic Feeder using Azure IoT, a Wio Terminal and maybe some more devices. You can check the Azure IoT project here [Azure IoT - Squirrel Feeder](https://aka.ms/AzureIoTSquirrelFeederGitHub).

Once the feeder was ready, I decided to add a new feature to the scenario, detecting when a squirrel üêøÔ∏è is nearby the feeder. In this repository I'll share:

- How to create an image recognition model using [Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/WhatisAzureML-ci).
- How to export the model to a ML.Net image format.
- How to run the model in an Azure Function.

## Azure Machine Learning

[Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/WhatisAzureML-ci) is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle. Machine learning professionals, data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps.

You can create a model in Azure Machine Learning or use a model built from an open-source platform, such as Pytorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn. MLOps tools help you monitor, retrain, and redeploy models.

## ML.NET

ML.NET gives you the ability to add machine learning to .NET applications, in either online or offline scenarios. With this capability, you can make automatic predictions using the data available to your application. Machine learning applications make use of patterns in the data to make predictions rather than needing to be explicitly programmed.

Central to ML.NET is a machine learning model. The model specifies the steps needed to transform your input data into a prediction. With ML.NET, you can train a custom model by specifying an algorithm, or you can import pre-trained TensorFlow and ONNX models.

Once you have a model, you can add it to your application to make the predictions.

ML.NET runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS using .NET Core, or Windows using .NET Framework. 64 bit is supported on all platforms. 32 bit is supported on Windows, except for TensorFlow, LightGBM, and ONNX-related functionality.

For this scenario we will use ML.Net to create an image recognition model. This model will be trained on a dataset of images of squirrels üêøÔ∏è. The Tutorial - [Train an image classification model in Azure using Model Builder](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/image-classification-model-builder) describes the necesary steps to create a model.

Once you select the **Image Classification** scenario, you can use the images in the "[AzureML/Train/](AzureML/Train/)" directory in this repository to train your model.

Here is the model performing live recognition in action:

## Exporting the model to ML.Net

Once the project  was trained, you can export it to several formats.

## Azure Function

Time to code! Let's create a new Azure Function Using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Azure Functions for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) extension. 


### Sample Code

You can view a sample function completed code in the "[AzureFunction/LobeSquirrelDetectorFunction/](AzureFunction/LobeSquirrelDetectorFunction/)" directory in this repository.


## Testing the sample

Once our code is complete we can test the sample in local mode or in Azure Functions, after we deploy the Function. In both scenarios we can use any tool or language that can perform HTTP POST requests to the Azure Function to test our function.

### Test using Curl

Curl is a command line tool that allows you to send HTTP requests to a server. It is a very simple tool that can be used to send HTTP requests to a server. We can test the local function using curl with the following command:

```bash
‚ùØ curl http://localhost:7071/api/LobeSquirrelDetectorFunction -Method 'Post' -InFile 01.jpg
```

### Test using Postman

**Postman** is a great tool to test our function. You can use it to test the function in local mode and also to test the function once it has been deployed to Azure Functions. You can download Postman [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

In order to test our function we need to know the function url. In Visual Studio Code, we can get the url by clicking on the Functions section in the Azure Extension. Then we can right click on the function and select "Copy Function URL".

<img src="img/CopyAzureFunctionUrl.jpg" width="450"/>

Now we can go to Postman and create a new POST request using our function url. We can also add the image we want to test. Here is a live demo, with the function running locally, in Debug mode in Visual Studio Code:

<img src="img/AzFncLocalTestWithPostman.gif" width="700"/>

We are now ready to test our function in Azure Functions. To do so we need to deploy the function to Azure Functions. And use the new Azure Function url with the same test steps.
